# Movie-Zone

# User Story
As a movie goer I want to easily search for a released movie and receive *reviews/ratings*, a short description and the places that I can stream, buy or rent it from.
I also want to be able to store my recent searches for future references and update them when I want to.

# Description
The Movie-Zone is a reponsive front-end application that allows the user to search movie databases for a film of their choice.

When the Movie-Zone application is opened, the user can see a navigation bar with a hamburger menu *which will store their first three* searched for movies as they move through the app.

There is an invitation to type a movie title in the search box. When the search button is clicked, the movie title, a poster and a short description is displayed underneath.
Below this information is a *button* which links to another page to display all of the details of where the user can access the movie whether it's *Netflix, Amazon, TV* etc.
