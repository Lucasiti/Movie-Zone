# **Movie-Zone App**

# User Story
As a movie goer I want to easily search for a released movie and receive *reviews/ratings*, a short description and the places that I can stream, buy or rent it from.
I also want to be able to store my recent searches for future references and update them when I want to.

# Description
The Movie-Zone is a responsive front-end application that allows the user to search movie databases for a film of their choice.

When the Movie-Zone application is opened, the user can see a navigation bar with a hamburger menu which will eventually store their first four searched for movies as they move through the app.

After the Movie-Zone logo,there is an invitation to type a movie title in the search box. When the search button is clicked, the movie title, a poster and a short description is displayed underneath.<br/>
Below this information is a *watch now* button which links to another page to display all of the details of where the user can access the movie whether it's via *streaming, renting or buying*.<br/>
There is also a *like* button which can be clicked to add the film title to the favourites hamburger menu.
When a title is selected from the *favourites* menu the connected movie card is recalled with it's details.
